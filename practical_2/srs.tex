\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

\section{Purpose}
\label{purpose}
This project targets the generic implementation of web portal so that any user can deploy their client-server architecture.
The project is capable of deploying any e-commerce/management system with just following few simple steps in wizard.

\section{Project Scope}
\label{scope}
This Generic Web Portal is a "Software as a service" for user or a company who wants to launch their e-commerce site or a management portal for item/product sales, purchase, accounting etc. This generic service helps stakeholders to launch it in just few steps such as some required information, policy agreement and payment to launch the desire service platform of their own. \\
Here to make the system generic all the products are treated like object as if in book store books are considered as  objects having their properties unique (ISBN) and non-unique(Author, Title, Publisher, etc). similarly if it is for hotel management system rooms are treated as an object having their unique properties like room number or assigned id and non-unique properties such as availability, facility, floor, etc. Hence just by interpreting each product of real world as an object and treating it's use as a transaction.
\\
Also the system is meant to follow disciplined agile delivery such that it will be compatible to adapt new requirements and/or changes with the help of support option such that a company or user can deploy a new system of their own instead of using generic platform.

\chapter{Overall Description}

\section{Product Perspective}
\label{product_perspective}
The diagram below shows the perspective of a system.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering	
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{perspective.png}
\caption{Product Perspective}
\end{figure}
When a user visits the platform on web, the task for user is to just decide their requirement and choose suitable management portal and it will be deployed by just following simple steps includes information fill up and payment service and user verification

\section{Product Features}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Easy to deploy web service on SaaS
	\item Isolation for different user
	\item Generic Web Platform to deploy various kind of web service i.e. accounting, inventory management, hotel management, hospital management or any kind of product or utility management system
	\item To be known and marketed as PaaS and SaaS
	\item System is scalable up to simple accounting management to e-commerce platform
	\item Dashboard for analytics and database management
	\item Various set of permission management
	\item follows guideline of OWASP guidelines
	\item Easy to consume APIs
\end{enumerate}

\section{User Classes and Characteristics}
There are three kind of users utilizing the system:
\paragraph[developerRole]{Developer} Developer can be individual or part of a team or company accessing the system to deploy their web service
\paragraph[endUser]{End User} end users access the system to interact with already deployed web service by Developer

\section{Operating Environment}
The Platform is deployed on centralized server hence any user having a web browser and active Internet connection can interact with this portal.

\section{Design and Implementation Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
	\item However user can interact with any web browser which is constrained by hardware capability and operating system. Hence It is require to have enough free memory and storage space for web browser on the device. 
	\item Also it is recommended that user should use latest available web browser.
	\item Depending on web browser type and version user interface and interaction ease may slightly vary.
	\item Performance of page load are also depended upon user's bandwidth too and user needs to have a stable Internet connection with good speed
\end{itemize}


\section{User Documentation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item API documentation for developer
	\item online help and support for deployment
	\item video tutorial to show a demo of deployment
\end{itemize}
Rest of related document for end-user needs to be prepared by the web service owner/developer team whoever deployed the web service.

\section{Assumptions and Dependencies}
The Platform has only term agreement with the owner of web service. As the end-user (if any) will be consuming services provided by respective web service owner and for any help and support related to web service user needs to follow contact to support team of respective web service. i.e. if a end-user is accessing hotel management service deployed by a company XYZ and has any query or issue related to the system then this end-user needs to contact support staff of company XYZ only.

User may need to allow executing javascripts and image to experience the system else the page may not work as expected or may not work at all.
The end-user might have to allow additional access to the camera or flash plugin or any other plugin or add on if it is require by web service owner.

\chapter{System Features}
$<$This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the 
product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may 
prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, 
object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the 
most logical sense for your product.$>$

\section{System Feature 1}
$<$Don’t really say “System Feature 1.” State the feature name in just a few 
words.$>$

\subsection{Description and Priority}
$<$Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of 
High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority 
component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a 
relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).$>$
